# Disentangling the Developmental Cascades Between Adolescent Maltreatment and Internalizing and Externalizing Problems: From Between-Person Differences to Within-Person Changes

**⚠️ Note:** This repository is currently a work in progress. Due to the extensive volume of Mplus syntax code involved in this study, the files are currently being organized and cleaned. A more structured version will be available soon.

## Overview

This repository contains the Mplus source code and syntax used for the analyses presented in the paper titled above. The primary goal of this project is to disentangle the between-person differences from within-person changes in the developmental associations between adolescent maltreatment and psychopathology.

The analysis utilizes the **Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RI-CLPM)** framework to examine these developmental cascades.

## Repository Contents

* **Mplus Code/**: Contains the `.inp` input files for the RI-CLPM models.
* *(Files are currently being uploaded and sorted)*

## Methodology

The models were estimated using **Mplus**. The code implements the RI-CLPM to account for stable trait-like differences between individuals while estimating the autoregressive and cross-lagged effects at the within-person level.
